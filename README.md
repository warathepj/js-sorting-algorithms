# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive web-based tool for visualizing common sorting algorithms in action. This project helps users understand how different sorting algorithms work through visual representation.

## Features

- Visualize multiple sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
- Adjustable animation speed- Generate new random arrays
- Real-time status updates during sorting
- Responsive design

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu
3. Use the "Generate New Array" button to create a new random array
4. Adjust the speed slider to control the visualization speed
5. Click "Start Sorting" to begin the visualization

## How It Works

- Each array element is represented by a vertical bar
- Bar height corresponds to the element's value
- Red bars indicate elements being compared
- Green bars represent the default state
- The status message shows current operation details

## Sorting Algorithms Implemented

### Bubble Sort

- Repeatedly steps through the list- Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they're in the wrong order
- Time Complexity: O(n²)

### Selection Sort- Divides input into sorted and unsorted regions

- Repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted region- Time Complexity: O(n²)

### Insertion Sort

- Builds the final sorted array one item at a time- Takes each element and places it in its correct position
- Time Complexity: O(n²)

## Technologies Used

- HTML5- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)- No external libraries or frameworks required
